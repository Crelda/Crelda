- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Crelda and I am new to github.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning how to use certain features in Swift / UIKit.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to learn how to produce paper printout (via Airprint) of a business invoice containing a graphic logo plus a batiable amount og text, not by using html or pdf approach.
- it has been a real struggle to get practical info on this subject, since the Apple docs are very cryptic and confusing. also all of the articles and videos are about printing pdf's.
- so I'm hoping to find someone who has figured out how to use UIPrintinteractionController and UIPrintPageRenderer.
